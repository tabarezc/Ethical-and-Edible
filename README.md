# Ethical-and-Edible
Release 2 Notes (11/22/2020):
Steps to view html files:
1) Download all files to a local computer
2) Open them using local browser
3) Some buttons work and some don't
4) To view a functional search.html page, make sure Python installed to be able to start a local server on your machine. Our group used this command:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000. Once the search.html is launched, type in "test recipe" or "test recipe2", hit Enter, and it will show ingredients in the right column.
